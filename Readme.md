## 📖 Abstract  
Mental disorders are increasingly reflected in online discourse. **MeDiTate** leverages **multimodal deep learning techniques** to analyze textual and behavioral signals from social media for **accurate detection** of mental disorder states.  

Our goal is to support research in **computational mental health** and provide reproducible tools for further exploration.
